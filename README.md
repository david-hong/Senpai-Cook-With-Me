Senpai Cook With Me
=====================

- an android app that implements Google's "text-to-speech", JSoup and wit.ai's respective API
- the app, when given a link, parses the webpage's HTML and returns the recipe, reading it out loud through Google's text-to-speech engine. Using wit.ai it listens to the user if a step is to be repeated, the next/previous step is desired, etc.
- used wit.ai such that keywords are recognized and action is taken
- refining the app so that it can be used without solely with voice recognition and hand gestures
- integrating android's built in hardware features such as light sensor's to recognize when to start listening to the userless


User Interface (WIP)
